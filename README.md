- Hi, I’m @HoustonKoester
- This is a very new github mainly used for CodeAcademy challenges, but some of my prior class work is on here as well.
- I’m currently learning machine learning with python and also full stack development through CodeAcademy while working on various other projects
- How to reach me, I'm always available at houstonkoester@aol.com!
